# E-Commerce Sentiment Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from e-commerce platforms to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) towards products. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, we aim to automate the process of sentiment analysis to aid in customer feedback management and product improvement strategies.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from e-commerce review datasets.
- Implementation of NLP techniques for text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- Training machine learning models to classify reviews into sentiment categories.
- Analysis of model performance and insights into customer sentiments.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd e_commerce_sentiment_analysis
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the sentiment analysis, use the following command:
```
python sentiment_analysis.py --reviews_path <path_to_reviews_file>
```
Replace `<path_to_reviews_file>` with the path to your file containing e-commerce reviews.
